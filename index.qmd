**This website is currently under construction. For the moment, please refer to [here](https://social-econ-psych.univie.ac.at/team/qinyu-xiao/) for more complete and up-to-date information about me.**

I am a PhD student at the [Social and Economic Psychology Group](https://social-econ-psych.univie.ac.at/) (PI: Prof. Dr. [Robert BÃ¶hm](http://robertboehm.info/)) at the [Department of Occupational, Economic and Social Psychology](https://psychologie.univie.ac.at/en/research/departments/department-of-occupational-economic-and-social-psychology/), University of Vienna, Austria. I received my M.Phil. in social psychology and B.A. in psychology and philosophy from the University of Hong Kong.

My research aims to understand social decision-making in the face of large-scale pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, intergroup conflicts, and inequality. With experimental, survey, and computational methods, I study human cooperation, prosociality, and social institutions. I strive to be interdisciplinary in research, by referring to theories and methods from economics, evolutionary biology, etc. I strongly support open science and make my work as transparent and reproducible as possible.
