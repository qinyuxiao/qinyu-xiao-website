For the moment, please refer to here for more complete and up-to-date information about me.\nI am a PhD student at the Social and Economic Psychology Group (PI: Prof. Dr. Robert Böhm) at the Department of Occupational, Economic and Social Psychology, University of Vienna, Austria. I received my M.Phil. in social psychology and B.A. in psychology and philosophy from the University of Hong Kong.\nMy research aims to understand social decision-making in the face of large-scale pressing societal challenges, such as climate change, intergroup conflicts, and inequality. With experimental, survey, and computational methods, I study human cooperation, prosociality, and social institutions. I strive to be interdisciplinary in research, by referring to theories and methods from economics, evolutionary biology, etc. I strongly support open science and make my work as transparent and reproducible as possible."
